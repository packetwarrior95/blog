Hey, I am Christopher (27 years old) from Frankfurt (Germany) and I am an IT professional currently employed as Consulting Engineer at Cisco. 
Previously, I worked as an Cybersecurity Consultant and IT systemadministrator. This allowed me to gain technical experience with a wide range of IT systems.

I found strong interest in networks, automation as well as cybersecurity and studying to deepen my knowledge in enterprise networks and cybersecurity.

I am passionate about IT in general and looking forward to connect with people and have conversations about our great field.

My published articles will have a focus on networking and cybersecurity but occasionally there could always be a general IT topic.

Feel free to keep in touch using your preferred social media â€“ I have linked to all my social media accounts to the left!

Have a good read !  
Christopher
