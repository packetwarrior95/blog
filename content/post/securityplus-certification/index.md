Hello guys,

I just passed my Security+ exam on the first attempt and wanted to show you what resources I used and how my experience can prepare you for the exam. Additionally, here is my personal opinion about the certificate and what I learned from it.  

## My Testcenter Exam-Experience

I took the exam in Frankfurt (Germany) at a Pearson-Vue Testcenter.
Of course I was nervous :) The staff was nice and did a good job of making me a little less nervous. But as soon as I was brought into the testing room and the exam started I was able to concentrate and block out the rest. I could see that someone took the AWS Solution-Architect exam and I just thought to myself that this guys has a way harder task then I should be able to pass this little Security+ exam.  
  
When I saw the screen with "Passed" after the compTia survey, I said "yes" and made like a victory fist and then quietly left the room.  

## My Study-Resources and Exam-Preaparation

My employer bought me the compTia-bundle with the Voucher, Official Study Guide and the CertMaster.  

I read the whole Official Book (620 sites) and made the exercises.
Then I made flashcards in [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net) 4 weeks before the exam to remember the most important concepts and things I had problems with. The last two weeks I downloaded the official free Security+ App from the AppStore. The App is way better than the Cert-Master because the questions did not felt they were near the exam-questions. The App is not so much talked about/known and kinda underrated. In the endphase I watched Professor Messer YT-Videos on topics I had problems with like PKI or Cross-Site Scripting and did CertMaster-Questions.

* Read the Official Study Guide
* Made Anki Flashcards for the most important concepts/topics
* Watched [Professor Messer YouTube-Videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NE33fpQuw8&list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8) on difficult topics
* Free Security+ App -> [Apple](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/comptia-security-exam-prep/id1501784033) & [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.abc.comptiasecurityplus&hl=gsw&gl=US) 
* CertMaster Questions and Exercises

## Exam-Tips

Just quick exam-tips for the final day.  
* Do not learn anything on the exam-day, it just makes you insecure!
* Drink and eat something healthy before your exam (Water & Fruits)
* When you cannot solve fast the performance-based questions then flag them and go next. You can review and continue with them after you finished the rest.

## My opinion on the Security+ Certification

I work right now already in the Cybersecurity-area as SOC-Analyst but I still learned alot I would say. The certification gives you a really good oversight about Cybersecurity and all its areas. After the certification I felt I had a better understanding for Cybersecurity. It really surprised me how big of a part availability and Disaster-Recovery of servers are in Cybersecurity. I always thought the operations-team or serveradmins were responsible for that. I can recommend this certification to everyone, even when you do not work specifically in Cybersecurity since security will play a major role in the future.  


I hope this was useful for you and helps you a little bit for your certification√∂
