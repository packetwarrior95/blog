[{"content":"Hello,\nwhile studying for my CCNA certification I came across mindmaps and how they help you to study and get a feeling for the certifiation.\nThe following applies for all technical certifications. In my case I created a CCNA-mindmap.\nWhy Mindmaps are useful when learning for your certification Mindmaps give you a visual overview of the exam and the specific topics you need to know to pass the exam.\nMindmapping is an active learning techniques where we retrieve information. Our brain does not store information as words, sentences or paragraphs. Instead, it keeps information as key points, diagrams and pictures. Mindmapping for studying is beneficial because mindmaps work similar to that of your brain. It makes information absorption easy.\nThis article from Moniul goes more in-depth with reasearches and explanations how mindmaps help you to study. Check it out !\nX-Mind (free Mindmap-Software) I recommend the free Mindmap-Software XMIND.\nIf you really love it you can buy the annual subscription (60$) for additional features.\nThe software is easy to use You get quickly started and create your own mindmaps XMIND automatically adjust colors so they play well together Change the layout or the form of objectives on the fly Lots of Mindmap-Templates My CCNA-Mindmap (Download-Links included) When I created the mindmap for the CCNA, I divided the topics into the five main domains network fundamentals, network access, IP connectivity, IP services, security fundamentals and automation. Then I created subnodes for every topic and subnodes of the subnodes when the topic goes deeper and many concepts also technical terms need to be known.\nDownload my CCNA-Mindmap on my Github Profile as PDF, PNG or XMIND-File.\nYou can edit the CCNA-mindmap with the xmind-file as you like when you download XMIND.\nFind Template-Mindmaps with mindmeister Mindmeister is another online-tool for creating mindmaps.\nThis website has a extensive public mindmap-database for certifications.\nExamples:\nCCNA AWS Solution Architect Associate MS Azure Administrator CompTia Security+ Another resource for Mindmap-Templates is Biggerplate.\nI recommend you to make your own mindmap but you can also download a finished mindmap to get inspired or to get a quick overview.\nI hope this was useful for you and helps you in your learning-process to get your certification.\nReach out on my social-media accounts when you have any questions.\nThanks for reading,\nChristopher\n","date":"2022-08-02T00:00:00Z","image":"https://packet-warrior.net/p/how-mindmaps-help-you-study-for-your-cerification-ccna-example/xmind1_hu8a1a025d304985f580173e56de5febe3_64396_120x120_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://packet-warrior.net/p/how-mindmaps-help-you-study-for-your-cerification-ccna-example/","title":"How Mindmaps help you study for your cerification (CCNA example)"},{"content":"Hello guys,\nI just passed my Security+ exam on the first attempt and wanted to show you what resources I used and how my experience can prepare you for the exam. Additionally, here is my personal opinion about the certificate and what I learned from it.\nMy Testcenter Exam-Experience I took the exam in Frankfurt (Germany) at a Pearson-Vue Testcenter. Of course I was nervous :) The staff was nice and did a good job of making me a little less nervous. But as soon as I was brought into the testing room and the exam started I was able to concentrate and block out the rest. I could see that someone took the AWS Solution-Architect exam and I just thought to myself that this guys has a way harder task then I should be able to pass this little Security+ exam.\nWhen I saw the screen with \u0026ldquo;Passed\u0026rdquo; after the compTia survey, I said \u0026ldquo;yes\u0026rdquo; and made like a victory fist and then quietly left the room.\nMy Study-Resources and Exam-Preaparation My employer bought me the compTia-bundle with the Voucher, Official Study Guide and the CertMaster.\nI read the whole Official Book (620 sites) and made the exercises. Then I made flashcards in Anki 4 weeks before the exam to remember the most important concepts and things I had problems with. The last two weeks I downloaded the official free Security+ App from the AppStore. The App is way better than the Cert-Master because the questions did not felt they were near the exam-questions. The App is not so much talked about/known and kinda underrated. In the endphase I watched Professor Messer YT-Videos on topics I had problems with like PKI or Cross-Site Scripting and did CertMaster-Questions.\nRead the Official Study Guide Made Anki Flashcards for the most important concepts/topics Watched Professor Messer YouTube-Videos on difficult topics Free Security+ App -\u0026gt; Apple \u0026amp; Android CertMaster Questions and Exercises Exam-Tips Just quick exam-tips for the final day.\nDo not learn anything on the exam-day, it just makes you insecure! Drink and eat something healthy before your exam (Water \u0026amp; Fruits) When you cannot solve fast the performance-based questions then flag them and go next. You can review and continue with them after you finished the rest. My opinion on the Security+ Certification I work right now already in the Cybersecurity-area as SOC-Analyst but I still learned alot I would say. The certification gives you a really good oversight about Cybersecurity and all its areas. After the certification I felt I had a better understanding for Cybersecurity. It really surprised me how big of a part availability and Disaster-Recovery of servers are in Cybersecurity. I always thought the operations-team or serveradmins were responsible for that. I can recommend this certification to everyone, even when you do not work specifically in Cybersecurity since security will play a major role in the future.\nI hope this was useful for you and helps you a little bit for your certification√∂\nReach out on my social-media accounts when you have any questions.\nThanks for reading,\nChristopher\n","date":"2022-07-22T00:00:00Z","image":"https://packet-warrior.net/p/how-i-passed-my-comptia-security-certification/SecurityPlus_Logo_Certified_CE_huab0b254a77801f8105de13f00a7c6471_126937_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://packet-warrior.net/p/how-i-passed-my-comptia-security-certification/","title":"How I passed my compTia Security+ Certification"},{"content":"Hello guys,\nhave you always wanted to replace the default symbols in EVE-NG and use your own ?
