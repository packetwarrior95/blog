[{"content":"Hello people,\ntoday I will explain you what EtherChannel exactly is and how you can configure it on your Cisco devices.\nWhat is EtherChannel? EtherChannel (also known as Link Aggregation or NIC Teaming) is a technology that enables the aggregation of multiple physical links into a single logical link. This is achieved by bundling together multiple Ethernet links and presenting them to the upper layer as a single high-bandwidth link. EtherChannel can be used to increase network bandwidth, improve network redundancy, and load balance traffic.\nEtherChannel technology was first introduced by Cisco Systems in the early 1990s, and it has since been widely adopted by other networking vendors. It is supported on various network devices including switches, routers, and servers.\nThere are two widely used EtherChannel-Protocols nowadays. Cisco proprietary EtherChannel protocol PAgP and LACP is defined in IEEE. 802.3ad. How EtherChannel Works EtherChannel works by bundling two or more Ethernet links together into a single logical link. This logical link appears to the upper layer as a single, high-bandwidth link. The physical links that make up the EtherChannel are called member links, and they must have the same speed and duplex settings.\nThere are two modes of EtherChannel: static and dynamic. In static mode, the network administrator manually configures the member links that will be bundled together into the EtherChannel. In dynamic mode, the network devices automatically negotiate the creation of the EtherChannel.\nThere are two protocols used for dynamic EtherChannel: Port Aggregation Protocol (PAgP) and Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP). PAgP is Cisco proprietary, while LACP is a standard protocol that is supported by multiple vendors. LACP is the recommended protocol to use for EtherChannel.\nBenefits of EtherChannel EtherChannel provides several benefits for your network-connections:\nIncreased bandwidth: By bundling multiple physical links, EtherChannel can provide a higher bandwidth. Improved redundancy: EtherChannel can provide redundancy in case of a link failure. If one member link fails, traffic is automatically redirected to the remaining links in the EtherChannel. Load balancing: EtherChannel can distribute traffic across the member links, which helps to balance the load and prevent bottlenecks. Simplified management: By bundling multiple physical links into a single logical link, network administrators can simplify the configuration and management of the network. EtherChannel Configuration The first step in configuring EtherChannel before configuring the correct protocol is to configure the same interface settings for each member link. This includes setting the speed and duplex settings, as well as any other relevant interface settings.\nFor example, to configure the interface settings for interfaces GigabitEthernet0/1-4 in order to create an L2 Etherchannel Trunk on a Cisco Switch, use the following commands:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 interface range GigabitEthernet0/1-4 switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q switchport mode trunk switchport nonegotiate speed 1000 duplex full Now we can continue with the etherchannel-protocol configuration using LACP or PAgP to create an aggregated port-channel. You have to decide first, which protocol you want to use and configure both connection ends with the same protocol.\nLACP Configuration Step 1: Enable LACP\nNow you need to enable LACP on each member link. LACP can be enabled using the channel-group command. For example, to enable LACP on interfaces GigabitEthernet0/1-4 and add it to channel group 1, use the following command:\n1 2 interface range GigabitEthernet0/1-4 channel-group 1 mode active The \u0026ldquo;mode active\u0026rdquo; command specifies that the interface should actively negotiate with other LACP-enabled interfaces to form an EtherChannel. Do the \u0026ldquo;mode active\u0026rdquo; command on both connection ends.\nNow a virtual Port-Channel 1 is created who acts as single link.\nHere is an overview how you can configure the channel-group modes in order to configure your desired protocol.\nStep 2: Verify LACP Configuration\nAfter configuring LACP on each member link, you should verify the configuration to ensure that LACP is working as expected. You can use the \u0026ldquo;show lacp neighbor\u0026rdquo; command to view information about the neighbor devices that are connected to each interface. For example, to view LACP information for interface GigabitEthernet0/1, use the following command:\n1 show lacp neighbor GigabitEthernet0/1 This command displays information such as the neighbor device ID, the neighbor port ID, the current LACP mode, and the LACP state.\nStep 3: Verify EtherChannel LACP Configuration\nAfter configuring the EtherChannel, you should verify the configuration to ensure that it is working as expected. You can use the \u0026ldquo;show etherchannel summary\u0026rdquo; command to view information about the EtherChannel configuration. For example, to view EtherChannel information for EtherChannel group 1, use the following command:\n1 show etherchannel summary | include Group 1 This command displays information such as the EtherChannel protocol, the number of member links, the operational status, and the load balancing method.\nPAgP Configuration Step 1: Enable PAgP\nNow you need to enable PAgP on each member link. PAgP can be enabled using the channel-group command. For example, to enable PAgP on interface GigabitEthernet0/1 and add it to channel group 1, use the following command:\n1 2 interface range GigabitEthernet0/1-4 channel-group 1 mode desirable The \u0026ldquo;mode desirable\u0026rdquo; command specifies that the interface should actively negotiate with other PAgP-enabled interfaces to form an EtherChannel.\nConfigure the \u0026ldquo;mode desirable\u0026rdquo; on both connection ends or look at the mode-chart from the previous configuration to enable a working PAgP Etherchannel\nStep 2: Verify PAgP Configuration\nAfter configuring PAgP on each member link, you should verify the configuration to ensure that PAgP is working as expected. You can use the \u0026ldquo;show PAgP neighbors\u0026rdquo; command to view information about the neighbor devices that are connected to each interface. For example, to view PAgP information for interface GigabitEthernet0/1, use the following command:\n1 show PAgP neighbors GigabitEthernet0/1 This command displays information such as the neighbor device ID, the neighbor port ID, the current PAgP mode, and the PAgP state.\nStep 3: Verify EtherChannel PAgP Configuration\nAfter configuring the EtherChannel PAgP, you should verify the configuration to ensure that it is working as expected. You can use the \u0026ldquo;show etherchannel summary\u0026rdquo; command to view information about the EtherChannel configuration. For example, to view EtherChannel information for EtherChannel group 1, use the following command:\n1 show etherchannel summary | include Group 1 This command displays information such as the EtherChannel protocol, the number of member links, the operational status, and the load balancing method.\nI hope this article was valuable for you and helps in your IT-Journey.\nReach out on my social-media accounts when you have any questions.\nThanks for reading,\nChristopher\n","date":"2023-05-04T00:00:00Z","image":"https://packet-warrior.net/p/etherchannel-explained-overview-and-configuration/network_hu12d4a0ff41122c69622c50700511ad93_111666_120x120_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://packet-warrior.net/p/etherchannel-explained-overview-and-configuration/","title":"EtherChannel Explained: Overview and Configuration"},{"content":"Hello guys,\nI just passed my CCNA exam on the first attempt and wanted to show you what resources I used and how my experience can help prepare you for the exam.\nMy Testcenter Exam-Experience I took the exam in Frankfurt (Germany) at the same Pearson-Vue Testcenter where I did he compTia+ Certification. At the beginning I was a little nervous but that was away when the exam started. It was really tough because you always had to absorb alot of information and the time was ticking so you really need to hurry to finish the exam in time.\nThe first simulation part was lots of configurations and I decided to skip it because it would take me too long to finish it. This was the correct decision in the end because I just finished the exam with 2 minutes left. I could focus the rest of the exam and managed to pass it.\nWhen I saw the screen with \u0026ldquo;Passed\u0026rdquo; after the Cisco survey, I was really happy and weight fell off from my shoulders.\nMy Study-Resources and Exam-Preaparation My employer Cisco had an internal training for the CCNA (of course).\nAdditionally I used the following resources:\nRead the Official CCNA Cert Guide Volume 1 \u0026amp; 2 Boson Ex-Sim Watched Jeremy IT Labs YouTube-Videos on difficult topics Creating my own labs with EVE-NG After reading the books, watching videos and doing labs I prepared one week before the exam with Boson Ex-SIM.

Where do you start ? Today I will show you how to start with Ansible in a practical scenario to get your feet wet with this topic. You can learn network automation while learning for your CCNA to make your own automated labs. This will gain you valuable knowledge for your future. You will need EVE-NG (open-source) for this tutorial. I will link you to sources where to go after the tutorial to gain more knowledge about Ansible since teaching the concepts of Ansible will exceed the frame of this blog post.\nRequirements installed and running version of EVE-NG in the same subnet as your homerouter basic network-knowledge and little experience with Cisco routers Cisco VIRL/CML Images (can only be purchased on the official Cisco Store) WinSCP or another SFTP-client Scenario / Goals We want to reach the goal in this scenario to configure the other interfaces of the routers Berlin and Paris and adding a static route, so that PC1 and PC2 can reach and ping each other. We will create a Ansible-Server which will orchestrate and configure the routers after we connect and configure the GigabitEthernert 0/0 interfaces of the routers to our home-subnet.\nSetup Ubuntu Server and install Ansible First you need to download this special EVE-NG Linux Ubuntu Image here and follow the instructions on the website.\nNow you will create a new EVE-NG Lab and will add a Linux-Ubuntu Server. You need to add now the other devices from the network-topology too. These are two cisco routers, one cisco switch, two virtual PC´s. Finally you need to add a network and select ManagementCloud so that it is bridged to your home-router subnet for the Internet connection. Connect the devices like in my network-topology. The ubuntu-server will get automatically a IP from your DHCP-server.\nStart up all devices. We have to configure only the two routers on one interface and to allow ssh, so Ansible will get acces to the devices to push the configurations to it. Set here static IP-adresses out of your home-router´s DHCP address-space.\nWe will configure now a initial config to each Cisco Router so we can push configs to them and configure automatically the remaining things. You have to do this then for the Router-Paris too and configure the correct IP-address. The Gi0/0 interface will get a static IP, SSH will be enabled and the SSH-User ansible with password ansible will be created.\nInitial Configuration for the Router-Berlin:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 Router-Berlin(config)#int Gi0/0 Router-Berlin(config)#ip addr 192.168.0.35 255.255.255.0 Router-Berlin(config)#no shutdown Router-Berlin#conf t Enter configuration commands, one per line. End with CNTL/Z. Router-Berlin(config)#username ansible priv 15 secret cisco Router-Berlin(config)#ip domain-name automation.com Router-Berlin(config)#crypto key generate rsa The name for the keys will be: Router-Berlin.automation.com Choose the size of the key modulus in the range of 360 to 4096 for your General Purpose Keys. Choosing a key modulus greater than 512 may take a few minutes. How many bits in the modulus [512]: 1024 % Generating 1024 bit RSA keys, keys will be non-exportable...

After that you can use your favorite SSH-Program to access the server.\n1 2 3 4 sudo apt-get update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; apt-get upgrade sudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration sudo systemctl enable ssh sudo systemctl start ssh Default login credentials for this image:\nUser: user / Password Test123 User: root / Password Test123 Now we will install Ansible with the following commands and verify the version at the end.\n1 2 3 4 5 $ sudo apt update $ sudo apt install software-properties-common $ sudo add-apt-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible $ sudo apt install ansible $ ansible --version Add the Berlin and Paris router to the local host-file on the ubuntu system so the FQDN will get resolved immediately. Add these two lines text into the host-file with the command nano /etc/host\n1 2 192.168.0.20 Router-Paris 192.168.0.35 Router-Berlin We will check now if we have a good and working network-connection with low latency to the Cisco-Routers. The results show we have a good connection between 1.5 and 2.5 ms.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 root@ubuntu22-server:/etc/ansible# ping Router-Berlin -c 5 PING Router-Berlin (192.168.0.35) 56(84) bytes of data. 64 bytes from Router-Berlin (192.168.0.35): icmp_seq=1 ttl=255 time=2.37 ms 64 bytes from Router-Berlin (192.168.0.35): icmp_seq=2 ttl=255 time=2.25 ms 64 bytes from Router-Berlin (192.168.0.35): icmp_seq=3 ttl=255 time=1.66 ms 64 bytes from Router-Berlin (192.168.0.35): icmp_seq=4 ttl=255 time=2.33 ms 64 bytes from Router-Berlin (192.168.0.35): icmp_seq=5 ttl=255 time=1.79 ms The SSH-Connection will not work because of different encryption-algorithms which are supported on these different ssh-program of the devices. Add the following lines to the SSH-config (~/.ssh/config) on the Ubuntu-server to allow different encryption-algorithms.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 root@ubuntu22-server:~# nano ~/.ssh/config add text Host 192.168.0.35 KexAlgorithms +diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1 HostkeyAlgorithms +ssh-rsa Host 192.168.0.20 KexAlgorithms +diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1 HostkeyAlgorithms +ssh-rsa Confirm working SSH-access by connecting to the router.\n1 ssh ansible@192.168.0.35 Uploading Ansible Files and Playbooks Download the ansible-networkautomation folder on my Github and upload it to your ubuntu-server to the path /etc/ansible (not the readme-file) with your favorite file-transfer program. I recommend WinSCP for this task. Here you can find playbooks and a hosts-file. In the playbook we define what we will configure and in the host-file we define which device we configure and what way/connection-type we use for it. If you used different IP-addresses than me, you have to edit the file /etc/ansible/hosts with your IP´s. The file-structure should look like this when you are done.\nExecuting Ansible playbooks for the automated configuration Finally we did all the preparation work.\nWe can finally push the configuration to the two routers to reach our goal and without manually executing commands on the routers.\nIf you want to execute an Ansible-Playbook to execute a change, you just need the command ansible-playbooks yaml-filename.\n1 sudo ansible-playbooks /etc/ansible/ccna-ansible/router_berlin_configuration.yaml You should now see something like this. Several changes were made. Here in the overview after the playbook-execution you see if something failed, if something was even changed and how many changes were done.\nWuhuhuu!! We successfully configured automated the other router interfaces and added a static route to the routing table.\nChecking the results / Can I ping PC2 from PC 1 ? In the final step we will confirm the Ansible configuration by connecting to the devices and checking the current configuration.\nPing from PC1 to PC2\nRouter-Berlin: Interface IP Configuration Router-Berlin: IP Routingtable We can confirm that everything was successful configured.\nWhere to get more information about Ansible Now you can continue to learn about Ansible with these resources:\nPluralsight-Course by Christopher Hart (recommended)\nOfficial Ansible Documentation\nCisco IOS Modules/Playbooks\nBooks: Mastering Python Networking by Eric Chou\nI hope you learnt something and my tutorial was useful : )\nReach out on my social-media accounts when you have any questions.\nThanks for reading,\nChristopher\n","date":"2022-11-03T00:00:00Z","image":"https://packet-warrior.net/p/automate-your-ccna-labs-with-ansible/ansible_cover_1_hu12e3a9305b0d27840b378eb3d2d37656_34383_120x120_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://packet-warrior.net/p/automate-your-ccna-labs-with-ansible/","title":"Automate your CCNA-Labs with Ansible"},{"content":"Hello,\nwhile studying for my CCNA certification I came across mindmaps and how they help you to study and get a feeling for the certifiation.\nThe following applies for all technical certifications.

My opinion on the Security+ Certification I work right now already in the Cybersecurity-area as SOC-Analyst but I still learned alot I would say. The certification gives you a really good oversight about Cybersecurity and all its areas. After the certification I felt I had a better understanding for Cybersecurity. It really surprised me how big of a part availability and Disaster-Recovery of servers are in Cybersecurity. I always thought the operations-team or serveradmins were responsible for that.
