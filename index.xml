&lt;p>I just passed my Security+ exam on the first attempt and wanted to show you what resources I used and how my experience can prepare you for the exam. Additionally, here is my personal opinion about the certificate and what I learned from it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="my-testcenter-exam-experience">My Testcenter Exam-Experience&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I took the exam in Frankfurt (Germany) at a Pearson-Vue Testcenter.
Of course I was nervous :) The staff was nice and did a good job of making me a little less nervous. But as soon as I was brought into the testing room and the exam started I was able to concentrate and block out the rest. I could see that someone took the AWS Solution-Architect exam and I just thought to myself that this guys has a way harder task then I should be able to pass this little Security+ exam.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I saw the screen with &amp;ldquo;Passed&amp;rdquo; after the compTia survey, I said &amp;ldquo;yes&amp;rdquo; and made like a victory fist and then quietly left the room.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="my-study-resources-and-exam-preaparation">My Study-Resources and Exam-Preaparation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>My employer bought me the compTia-bundle with the Voucher, Official Study Guide and the CertMaster.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I read the whole Official Book (620 sites) and made the exercises.
Then I made flashcards in &lt;a class="link" href="https://apps.ankiweb.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Anki&lt;/a> 4 weeks before the exam to remember the most important concepts and things I had problems with. The last two weeks I downloaded the official free Security+ App from the AppStore. The App is way better than the Cert-Master because the questions did not felt they were near the exam-questions. The App is not so much talked about/known and kinda underrated. In the endphase I watched Professor Messer YT-Videos on topics I had problems with like PKI or Cross-Site Scripting and did CertMaster-Questions.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Read the Official Study Guide&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Made Anki Flashcards for the most important concepts/topics&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Watched &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NE33fpQuw8&amp;amp;list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Professor Messer YouTube-Videos&lt;/a> on difficult topics&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Free Security+ App -&amp;gt; &lt;a class="link" href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/comptia-security-exam-prep/id1501784033" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Apple&lt;/a> &amp;amp; &lt;a class="link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.abc.comptiasecurityplus&amp;amp;hl=gsw&amp;amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Android&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>CertMaster Questions and Exercises&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="exam-tips">Exam-Tips&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Just quick exam-tips for the final day.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Do not learn anything on the exam-day, it just makes you insecure!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Drink and eat something healthy before your exam (Water &amp;amp; Fruits)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you cannot solve fast the performance-based questions then flag them and go next. You can review and continue with them after you finished the rest.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="my-opinion-on-the-security-certification">My opinion on the Security+ Certification&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I work right now already in the Cybersecurity-area as SOC-Analyst but I still learned alot I would say. The certification gives you a really good oversight about Cybersecurity and all its areas. After the certification I felt I had a better understanding for Cybersecurity. It really surprised me how big of a part availability and Disaster-Recovery of servers are in Cybersecurity. I always thought the operations-team or serveradmins were responsible for that. I can recommend this certification to everyone, even when you do not work specifically in Cybersecurity since security will play a major role in the future.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I hope this was useful for you and helps you a little bit for your certificationö&lt;/p>

Previously, I worked as an IT systemadministrator, IT support and IT project worker.&lt;br>
This allowed me to gain technical experience with a wide range of IT systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I found strong interest in networks and cybersecurity in my role as systemadministrator and currently I am studying for certificates to soon be able to work in the field of networking &amp;amp; network security.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Currently pursuing the compTia Security+ certification with an anticipated passing date of end of July.
Afterwards I want to finish the CCNA Certification (Cisco) in a time frame of 4 months which I started to learn for in the last months in my role as systemadministrator.&lt;br>
I am passionate about IT in general and looking forward to connect with people and have conversations about our great field.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My published articles will have a focus on networking and cybersecurity but occasionally there could always be a general IT topic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Feel free to keep in touch using your preferred social media – I have linked to all my social media accounts to the left!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Update (21.07.2022): I just passed my compTia Security+ certification&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Have a good read !&lt;br>

&lt;p>have you always wanted to replace the default symbols in EVE-NG and use your own ?
Today I will show you how to do this with little effort and even provide you with clear and beautiful blue network icons.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="requirements">Requirements&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>installed and functional version of EVE-NG in your preferred environment&lt;/li>
&lt;li>running SSH-Server on port 22&lt;/li>
&lt;li>WinSCP or another SFTP-client&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="how-to-add-your-own-symbols-in-eve-ng">How to add your own symbols in EVE-NG&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In the directory &lt;strong>/opt/unetlab/html/images/icons&lt;/strong> are stored all the symbols you can select when adding a device in the lab in EVE-NG. Now you just need to have your own custom symbols in the png-format and in the size 52x52 pixels.&lt;br>
Now just start your preferred SFTP-program, mine is &lt;a class="link" href="https://winscp.net/eng/download.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>WinSCP&lt;/a>, and connect via SSH to the directory and upload your symbols.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="adding-provided-blue-network-symbols">Adding provided blue network symbols&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Fortunately &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/ecceman/affinity" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Affinity&lt;/a> made beautiful and clear blue network symbols and &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/TheNetworkBerg/ecceman-affinity-EVE-NG-Symbols" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>The NetworkBerg&lt;/a> resized them in a finished png-format ready to use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Download the network symbols as zip-file from &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/TheNetworkBerg/ecceman-affinity-EVE-NG-Symbols" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>The NetworkBergs Github&lt;/a> and upload the zip-file to a random location in your EVE-NG machine via SFTP.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://packet-warrior.net/p/how-to-add-custom-symbols-in-eve-ng/eveng_symbol_upload.png"

class="gallery-image"
data-flex-grow="343"
data-flex-basis="823px"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now unzip the file in the EVE-NG machine with the following command via SSH.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;div class="chroma">
&lt;table class="lntable">&lt;tr>&lt;td class="lntd">
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code>&lt;span class="lnt">1
&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/td>
&lt;td class="lntd">
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-diff" data-lang="diff">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl"> unzip ecceman-affinity-EVE-NG-Symbols-master.zip
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;/table>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;p>Now move all the png-files in the correct directory for the symbols and we are finished !&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;div class="chroma">
&lt;table class="lntable">&lt;tr>&lt;td class="lntd">
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code>&lt;span class="lnt">1
&lt;/span>&lt;span class="lnt">2
&lt;/span>&lt;span class="lnt">3
&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/td>
&lt;td class="lntd">
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-diff" data-lang="diff">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl"> cd ecceman-affinity-EVE-NG-Symbols-master
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl"> cd Eccman\ Affinity\ Blue\ Circle\ Symbols/
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl"> mv * /opt/unetlab/html/images/icons
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;/table>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;h2 id="before-vs-after">before vs after&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Here you can take a look at an example with the new symbols in comparison to the standard-symbols in EVE-NG.&lt;/p>
