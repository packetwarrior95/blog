Previously, I worked as an IT systemadministrator, IT support and IT project worker.&lt;br>
This allowed me to gain technical experience with a wide range of IT systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I found strong interest in networks and cybersecurity in my role as systemadministrator and currently I am studying for certificates to soon be able to work in the field of networking &amp;amp; network security.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Currently pursuing the compTia Security+ certification with an anticipated passing date of end of July.
Afterwards I want to finish the CCNA Certification (Cisco) in a time frame of 4 months which I started to learn for in the last months in my role as systemadministrator.&lt;br>
I am passionate about IT in general and looking forward to connect with people and have conversations about our great field.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My published articles will have a focus on networking and cybersecurity but occasionally there could always be a general IT topic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Feel free to keep in touch using your preferred social media â€“ I have linked to all my social media accounts to the left!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Have a good read !&lt;br>
Christopher&lt;br>
