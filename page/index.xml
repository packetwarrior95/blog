Previously, I worked as an Cybersecurity Consultant and IT systemadministrator. This allowed me to gain technical experience with a wide range of IT systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I found strong interest in networks, automation as well as cybersecurity and studying to deepen my knowledge in enterprise networks and cybersecurity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am passionate about IT in general and looking forward to connect with people and have conversations about our great field.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My published articles will have a focus on networking and cybersecurity but occasionally there could always be a general IT topic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Feel free to keep in touch using your preferred social media â€“ I have linked to all my social media accounts to the left!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Have a good read !&lt;br>
Christopher&lt;br>
