&lt;p>while studying for my CCNA certification I came across mindmaps and how they help you to study and get a feeling for the certifiation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The following applies for all technical certifications. In my case I created a CCNA-mindmap.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-mindmaps-are-useful-when-learning-for-your-certification">Why Mindmaps are useful when learning for your certification&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Mindmaps give you a visual overview of the exam and the specific topics you need to know to pass the exam.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mindmapping is an active learning techniques where we retrieve information. Our brain does not store information as words, sentences or paragraphs. Instead, it keeps information as key points, diagrams and pictures. Mindmapping for studying is beneficial because mindmaps work similar to that of your brain. It makes information absorption easy.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="x-mind-free-mindmap-software">X-Mind (free Mindmap-Software)&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I recommend the free Mindmap-Software &lt;strong>&lt;a class="link" href="https://xmind.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>XMIND&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you really love it you can buy the annual subscription (60$) for additional features.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The software is easy to use&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You get quickly started and create your own mindmaps&lt;/li>
&lt;li>XMIND automatically adjust colors so they play well together&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Change the layout or the form of objectives on the fly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Lots of Mindmap-Templates&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="my-ccna-mindmap-download-links-included">My CCNA-Mindmap (Download-Links included)&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When I created the mindmap for the CCNA, I divided the topics into the five main domains network fundamentals, network access, IP connectivity, IP services, security fundamentals and automation. Then I created subnodes for every topic and subnodes of the subnodes when the topic goes deeper and many concepts also technical terms need to be known.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Download my CCNA-Mindmap on my &lt;strong>&lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/packetwarrior95/mindmap-ccna" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p>You can edit the CCNA-mindmap with the xmind-file as you like when you download XMIND.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I just passed my Security+ exam on the first attempt and wanted to show you what resources I used and how my experience can prepare you for the exam. Additionally, here is my personal opinion about the certificate and what I learned from it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="my-testcenter-exam-experience">My Testcenter Exam-Experience&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I took the exam in Frankfurt (Germany) at a Pearson-Vue Testcenter.
Of course I was nervous :) The staff was nice and did a good job of making me a little less nervous. But as soon as I was brought into the testing room and the exam started I was able to concentrate and block out the rest. I could see that someone took the AWS Solution-Architect exam and I just thought to myself that this guys has a way harder task then I should be able to pass this little Security+ exam.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I saw the screen with &amp;ldquo;Passed&amp;rdquo; after the compTia survey, I said &amp;ldquo;yes&amp;rdquo; and made like a victory fist and then quietly left the room.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="my-study-resources-and-exam-preaparation">My Study-Resources and Exam-Preaparation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>My employer bought me the compTia-bundle with the Voucher, Official Study Guide and the CertMaster.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I read the whole Official Book (620 sites) and made the exercises.
Then I made flashcards in &lt;a class="link" href="https://apps.ankiweb.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Anki&lt;/a> 4 weeks before the exam to remember the most important concepts and things I had problems with. The last two weeks I downloaded the official free Security+ App from the AppStore. The App is way better than the Cert-Master because the questions did not felt they were near the exam-questions. The App is not so much talked about/known and kinda underrated. In the endphase I watched Professor Messer YT-Videos on topics I had problems with like PKI or Cross-Site Scripting and did CertMaster-Questions.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Read the Official Study Guide&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Made Anki Flashcards for the most important concepts/topics&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Watched &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NE33fpQuw8&amp;amp;list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Professor Messer YouTube-Videos&lt;/a> on difficult topics&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Free Security+ App -&amp;gt; &lt;a class="link" href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/comptia-security-exam-prep/id1501784033" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Apple&lt;/a> &amp;amp; &lt;a class="link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.abc.comptiasecurityplus&amp;amp;hl=gsw&amp;amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Android&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>CertMaster Questions and Exercises&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="exam-tips">Exam-Tips&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Just quick exam-tips for the final day.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Do not learn anything on the exam-day, it just makes you insecure!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Drink and eat something healthy before your exam (Water &amp;amp; Fruits)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you cannot solve fast the performance-based questions then flag them and go next. You can review and continue with them after you finished the rest.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="my-opinion-on-the-security-certification">My opinion on the Security+ Certification&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I work right now already in the Cybersecurity-area as SOC-Analyst but I still learned alot I would say. The certification gives you a really good oversight about Cybersecurity and all its areas. After the certification I felt I had a better understanding for Cybersecurity. It really surprised me how big of a part availability and Disaster-Recovery of servers are in Cybersecurity. I always thought the operations-team or serveradmins were responsible for that. I can recommend this certification to everyone, even when you do not work specifically in Cybersecurity since security will play a major role in the future.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I hope this was useful for you and helps you a little bit for your certificationö&lt;/p>
