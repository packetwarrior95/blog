&lt;p>I just passed my CCNA exam on the first attempt and wanted to show you what resources I used and how my experience can help prepare you for the exam.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="my-testcenter-exam-experience">My Testcenter Exam-Experience&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I took the exam in Frankfurt (Germany) at the same Pearson-Vue Testcenter where I did he compTia+ Certification.
At the beginning I was a little nervous but that was away when the exam started. It was really tough because you always had to absorb alot of information and the time was ticking so you really need to hurry to finish the exam in time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first simulation part was lots of configurations and I decided to skip it because it would take me too long to finish it. This was the correct decision in the end because I just finished the exam with 2 minutes left.
I could focus the rest of the exam and managed to pass it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I saw the screen with &amp;ldquo;Passed&amp;rdquo; after the Cisco survey, I was really happy and weight fell off from my shoulders.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="my-study-resources-and-exam-preaparation">My Study-Resources and Exam-Preaparation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>My employer Cisco had an internal training for the CCNA (of course).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Additionally I used the following resources:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Read the Official CCNA Cert Guide Volume 1 &amp;amp; 2&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Boson Ex-Sim&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Watched &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8W9oMNSuwo&amp;amp;list=PLxbwE86jKRgMpuZuLBivzlM8s2Dk5lXBQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Jeremy IT Labs YouTube-Videos&lt;/a> on difficult topics&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Creating my own labs with EVE-NG&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>After reading the books, watching videos and doing labs I prepared one week before the exam with Boson Ex-SIM.
The explanations in the Ex-Sim really helped me to remember the detailed info and concepts of important CCNA-topics.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="exam-tips">Exam-Tips&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Just quick exam-tips for the CCNA:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Do not learn anything on the exam-day, it just makes you more insecure!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Make sure you know the following topics in-depth: OSPF, IPv4 Routing &amp;amp; WLAN&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If the simulations take too long for you, just move on without finishing it (I only finished the second one to 80%)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You have to absorb alot of info every question. Read the question first and then search the required info.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There are experimental questions in the exam that will not get counted. Do net let you feel discouraged by these questions.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I hope this was useful for you and helps you for your CCNA-certification.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Thanks for reading,&lt;br>

&lt;p>while studying for my CCNA certification I came across mindmaps and how they help you to study and get a feeling for the certifiation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The following applies for all technical certifications. In my case I created a CCNA-mindmap.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-mindmaps-are-useful-when-learning-for-your-certification">Why Mindmaps are useful when learning for your certification&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Mindmaps give you a visual overview of the exam and the specific topics you need to know to pass the exam.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mindmapping is an active learning techniques where we retrieve information. Our brain does not store information as words, sentences or paragraphs. Instead, it keeps information as key points, diagrams and pictures. Mindmapping for studying is beneficial because mindmaps work similar to that of your brain. It makes information absorption easy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This &lt;strong>&lt;a class="link" href="https://moinulkarim.com/how-to-use-mind-maps-for-studying" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>article&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> from Moniul goes more in-depth with reasearches and explanations how mindmaps help you to study. Check it out !&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="x-mind-free-mindmap-software">X-Mind (free Mindmap-Software)&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I recommend the free Mindmap-Software &lt;strong>&lt;a class="link" href="https://xmind.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>XMIND&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you really love it you can buy the annual subscription (60$) for additional features.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The software is easy to use&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You get quickly started and create your own mindmaps&lt;/li>
&lt;li>XMIND automatically adjust colors so they play well together&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Change the layout or the form of objectives on the fly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Lots of Mindmap-Templates&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="my-ccna-mindmap-download-links-included">My CCNA-Mindmap (Download-Links included)&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When I created the mindmap for the CCNA, I divided the topics into the five main domains network fundamentals, network access, IP connectivity, IP services, security fundamentals and automation. Then I created subnodes for every topic and subnodes of the subnodes when the topic goes deeper and many concepts also technical terms need to be known.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Download my CCNA-Mindmap on my &lt;strong>&lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/packetwarrior95/mindmap-ccna" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Github Profile&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> as PDF, PNG or XMIND-File.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can edit the CCNA-mindmap with the xmind-file as you like when you download XMIND.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.mindmeister.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Mindmeister&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> is another online-tool for creating mindmaps.&lt;br>
This website has a extensive public mindmap-database for certifications.&lt;/p>
